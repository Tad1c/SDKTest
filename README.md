# SDKTest

To test the applicatin all you need is to navigate to SampleScene and press play.

Evrything is managed by APIManager script and I have explain in each line of code what it does.

There are other classes such as Card.cs and PaymentDetails.cs those are just for storing data and creating JSON file

DisplayCard.cs is used for updating the UI

PaymentForm.cs is for storing data that the user have entered and also passing/submit that data to APIManager, so APIManager can send that data to the server.
